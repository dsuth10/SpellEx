# Microsoft Forms Assessment

This skill enables the creation of multiple-choice assessment documents optimized for Microsoft Forms import.

## Formatting Requirements

To ensure Microsoft Forms can correctly parse the document, follow these exact formatting rules:

### 1. Question Format
- Every question must start with a number followed by a period or closing parenthesis (e.g., "1." or "1)").
- The question text should be on the same line as the number or immediately follow it.

### 2. Multiple Choice Options
- Each question must have exactly four multiple-choice options.
- Options must be labelled **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D** followed by a period or closing parenthesis (e.g., "A." or "A)").
- Each option should be on its own line.

### 3. Correct Answer Notation
- Immediately following the last option (D), the correct answer must be specified.
- Use the exact format: `ans: [X]` where `[X]` is the letter of the correct answer (A, B, C, or D).
- **Note**: The colon and space in `ans: ` are critical for the parser.

## Workflow

1. **Content Preparation**: Identify the questions, options, and correct answers.
2. **Document Creation**: Use the `docx` skill to create a new Word document.
3. **Drafting**: For each question, create a sequence of paragraphs:
   - Paragraph 1: Question (e.g., "1. What is the capital of Australia?")
   - Paragraph 2: Option A (e.g., "A. Sydney")
   - Paragraph 3: Option B (e.g., "B. Melbourne")
   - Paragraph 4: Option C (e.g., "C. Canberra")
   - Paragraph 5: Option D (e.g., "D. Brisbane")
   - Paragraph 6: Correct Answer (e.g., "ans: C")
4. **Finalisation**: Save the document as a `.docx` file.

## Example

**Question 1**
1. What two basic states of matter are mentioned in the text?
A. Solids and gases
B. Liquids and plasmas
C. Solids and liquids
D. None of the above
ans: C

## Integration with Docx Skill

This skill depends on the `docx` skill for the actual document generation logic. When using this skill, you must also load the `docx` skill and follow its "Creating a new Word document" workflow using `docx-js`.
